== `cmdhook.sh`

This example script exists to demonstrate how a user could write their own hooks that could be called via the `cmdhook` wrapper generation function.

The intent is to make output like this:

.Example
[source,bash]
----
./examples/cmdhook.sh
----

.Example Output:

[source,text]
----
curl: (1) Protocol "uri" not supported or disabled in libcurl
parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 10
ls: cannot access '/does/not/exist': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove '/does/not/exist': No such file or directory
zsh: exit 1     ./examples/cmdhook.sh
----

More useful when one uses the `wrapcmd` hook functions and wrap a command as called in shell.

.Example:
[source,bash]
----
WRAP="jq" DEBUG=sure ./examples/cmdhook.sh
----

.Example Output:

[source,text]
----
curl: (1) Protocol "uri" not supported or disabled in libcurl

As one can see one will receive information one wouldn't get by default, or with `set -x` either. Specifically:

* What was `stdin` to the command, if it was provided as a pipe
* What was the commands `stdout`, if it was provided or output to a pipe
* What was the commands `stderr`, if it was provided or output to a pipe
* What was the commands working directory
* What was the commands return code
* What was the full path to the command and its args

[NOTE]
====
That hooks of any complexity could be conceived, but the intent here is to provide a
drop-in solution to help debug existing scripts without rewriting all of them logic wise.
====
This example script provides an example of writing one's own non default hook for the wrapper trampoline function that is created. One could imagine saving all this data in a timeline sequence to record all command executions, timing data etcâ€¦

For now the default hook should provide enough information to debug any existing command reasonably well.
