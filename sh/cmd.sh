# This command is crazy, however its meant to help debug any executable
#
# There are current caveats as well. Those include:
# - This entirely *breaks* pipes, on purpose, so what was parallel execution
#   becomes serialized.
# - This also breaks output to not interleave stdout/stderr, stdout is output
#   then stderr, if this is an issue this may be improved but for now its non
#   negotiable.
# - This also writes out many files and basically invokes a bit of overhead per
#   call, this too is unavoidable, its a trampoline function that wraps the
#   command.
#
# Arguments to function are simply the non fully prefixed commands to wrap.
# Note, they *MUST* be on $PATH
#
# Of particular note is that if we are run under test, e.g. shellspec
# we prefix the command name with sut, e.g. wrapcmd foo will result in a
# trampoline function of sutfoo not foo. This is to enable shellspec
# itself to be able to unit test the trampoline setup function below.
#
# Future enhancements will set this up to write stuff out to a timeline
# directory of wrapped commands, return codes, stdin/out/err as files.
#
# That is a future me task.

    # - Path of command and its arguments
    # - return code
    # - tempfile names used to store stdin/out/err
